    <h2 class="w3-wide">Revisiting The Office</h2>
	<p class="w3-justify">
		In <a href="WA4.html">weekly assignment 4</a>, I wrote about The Office, looking at ratings by episode. Admittedly, the analysis wasn't all that interesting, and the presentation was not overly pleasing. And since the rest of the course provided me with a plethora of tools, it is important to reconsider how to present this data. In order to begin thinking about this, I will consider three groups as an audience for presentation: a group with similar technical skills to me; the general public; and kids/teens.
	</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">
		First, an audience who is on a similar comfort level as me, in terms of data analysis and data in general. This group will know how to interpret data, will want to see code, and will be more technical, so it can be more interactive. For a group like this, a notebook would likely be most appropriate. Using Jupyter notebooks, for example, would allow the audience to look at the code and the visualizaitons at the same time. Being able to see the code will allow this group to judge my actual analysis, and therefore, they will get an unbiased story. If, for example, my techniques were a bit misleading, it would be pretty easy to see in what ways. From previous work of mine, <a href="wa7.html">THIS</a> is a decent example of how it can be useful for the codeblocks to be shown, that way it is easier to see how the visualizations are being created. This also helps for learning, as having documentation makes it much easier to be able to replicate things. In the case of presenting data about the popularity of the Office, it would be useful for this audience to see where the data came from, that way they can analyze it themselves if they want. It would also allow them to see specific calculations or aggregations that I may have made in my presentation, which can help improve their understanding of the data.
	</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">
		Second, the general public, who will have a wide range of technical ability. The general public will require very clear and transparent information, since it is very important to avoid bias, while simultaneously allowing them to make their own conclusions. If the storyline is fed directly to them, this could cause confirmation bias, which they might not even realize, so while the story may guide them to conclusions, it cannot force them there. It is probably pretty important to include a wide range of data and many different visualizations. That way, people can obtain a complete perspective, and therefore have an unbiased takeaway from the presentaion. 
	</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">
		Finally, the final audience for presentation will be kids or younger people, probably middle/high school. This group is comfortable and excited about technology, but maybe not very intelligent about what the data <i>means</i> yet. Kids will also be keen on interacting with the data in a fun way, since they know <i>how</i> to use the technology. For this group, an interactive webpage would likely be a good option. For a TV show, younger kids would probably want something pretty immersive, in order to keep their attention and make the data seem interesting. While TV data is not really too complicated, there may be cases where some statistical analysis is performed, or maybe regression analysis, and so it is important not to confuse the audience. Sometimes, data can be complex, and so using interaction can help give the audience the tools to discover and understand the data on their own. <a href="https://pudding.cool/2017/08/the-office/">Something like THIS</a> or <a href="https://pudding.cool/2021/01/cool/">THIS</a> could be an example of how data could be presented in an entertaining way.
