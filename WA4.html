When it comes to television shows, or anything in the entertainment industry, viewership and ratings are widely thought of as two of the most important metrics for success. While each has its own individual impact, many wonder which is more important, and what will lead to a more successful TV show. Should firms market heavily in order to draw as many viewers as possible, or should they focus more on having the best possible product? Does a good show attract viewership automatically, or do popular shows just keep getting better? <a href="https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page">The Office</a> is a prime example in thinking about these questions. It was one of the most popular shows of its time, and it aired for nearly a decade. Especially now, people look back on media and question whether it was over or under-rated. I will look to see whether or not The Office deserves its high praise, or if it is simply overrated by mainstream media.

	The Office was a re-adaptation of the earlier <a href="https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/The_Office_(UK)">British version</a> of the same name. The Brits' version wasn't rather smashing, in terms of success, but, of course, it did lead to the American success. With its recent removal from Netflix, it is interesting to look back on the success of the show. Netflix obviously made the show quite popular, with its on-demand availability, but the Office had already received high praise. Still, streaming is a newer phenomenon, and it has an undeniable effect. From music to movies, most forms of entertainment go through streaming. In 2020, its final year on the platform, <a href="https://qz.com/1956723/the-office-is-the-most-popular-tv-show-on-streaming/#:~:text=The%20Office%20was%20by%20far,yes%2C%20billion)%20minutes%20streamed.">The Office dwarfed other shows</a> in terms of minutes watched. For a show that ended over seven years ago - to still be this popular - it is apparent why NBC wants to control its rights.

	Starting with the dataset, I found that Ratings and Viewership were fairly connected. Using R, I found they had an r-squared value of about 0.487. <a href="https://blog.minitab.com/en/adventures-in-statistics-2/regression-analysis-how-do-i-interpret-r-squared-and-assess-the-goodness-of-fit">The r-squared value</a> tells us about the correlation between two variables - it ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 means perfect correlation and 0 means no correlation. A value of 0.487 isn't high correlation, by any means, but it does certainly imply the two are connected. Visually, there doesn't seem to be much correlation between ratings and viewership, even on the more popular episodes. Although towards the end of the show, around season seven, ratings and viewship both start to fall off, viewership more noticeably. Of course, this is around the same time when Steve Carrell left the show, and so surely there were many fans who stopped watching when Michael left. However, this may also show just how difficult it is to sustain success as a top show. It is slightly difficult to see on the graph below, but the dark grey represents the viewership, in millions per episode, and the yellow shows the IMDb rating for each episode.

	Looking more deeply into the data showed us how ratings and viewership were connected. It was interesting to see that the average rating was about 8.2, and the average viewership was about 7.2 million. This was especially of interest when it came to outliers. We could see in the graphic, that there was not too much of a fluctuation in ratings, and it didn't seem as if the viewership had much effect on whether there would be a much higher or lower rating. Both the overall trends and the outliers were more evident in terms of viewership instead of ratings. Maybe this implies the Office was simply a good show, and it's success isn't sensitive to how many people are watching. It could also show that there simply isn't much fluctuation, in terms of ratings, for a show as popular as the Office - people just won't rate episodes are very low, because they still see value in the show itself.

	Overall, it is hard to comment on whether something is overrated or not. In the case of The Office, its success seemed to be inevitable. After the show got on the ground running, it had a very solid run for several years. For a show to average more than 8/10 over nine seasons, you know that the creators are doing something right. Ratings and views might not be the most effective measurements, but they are certainly very tangible metrics, and they can help us understand comparisons. In the future, it would be interesting to see how Netflix changed the shows popularity. It would seem plausible that there was a change in the overall ratings from when the show was actively airing, versus streaming-only.

By the way, here is where I got my data from. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nehaprabhavalkar/the-office-dataset?select=the_office_series.csv"> The Office Data </a>
