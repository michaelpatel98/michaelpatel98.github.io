	<!Introduction>
	<p>
The week of 25 January 2021 was marked by attention to the extremely unusual trading activity involving the retailer GameStop. The company's stock saw huge fluctuations in prices and enormous volume in response to an online collective action campaign led by the sub-reddit /r/WallStreetBets to buy the stock and cause a "short squeeze" that inflicted billions of dollars of losses for some Wall Street hedge funds. There has been a growing divide between the so-called amateur investors and the big hedge funds. Reddit users united to beat these Wall Street investors at their own game. From this conflict, concerns have popped up from both sides: is it illegal for these Redditors to conspire like this, and should there be laws against it? The Reddit investors certainly took advantage of extreme Wall Street greed, however, and they wonder why they should be restricted from playing the game simply because they are not on the inside. There is now a ton of ambiguity surrounding this situation and potential ones to follow. In this essay, I will evaluate the implications of the event and discuss how it relates to several ethical themes.

	On yet another Wednesday in January of 2021, we saw an unexpected, yet somewhat inevitable hit on the American stock market. Gamestop found itself caught in the middle of huge hedge funds and the 'little guy' Redditors - something you might not have ever expected to hear, but then again, we have been in a succession of wild events. This event began with large money managers essentially betting that Gamestop's stock would fall, which was noticed by Redditors on /r/WallStreetBets. The Redditors then banded together, and drove Gamestop's price up dramatically. Now, we've seen both sides relentless to curb the activity of the other: Hedge funds want regulation against 'attacks' like this, while Redditors respond saying that we're just getting in on your own game. Of course, there have been several questions that have arisen regarding events like this in the future, ethics, and more. In this essay, I will discuss potential outcomes from the situation and how we should respond to the vast number of concerns that have come up.

<p>
	One of the biggest concerns surrounding the Gamestop stock is whether groups like /r/WallStreetBets should be allowed to conspire like this. Of course, this concern is voiced primarily from the perspective of those who lost money - the giant hedge funds. While their concern may be valid, it is important to realize that this is really the first time that they have ever been truly beaten by someone. Typically, they are able to control markets without being totally transparent. The thing is, Wall Street hedge funds have been doing the exact same thing, just without a challenge. They have finally faced a challenger, and as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chamath/"> Chamath Palihapitiya</a>, Social Capital CEO, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/chamath-palihapitiya-closes-gamestop-position-but-defends-individual-investors-right-to.html">said in an interview</a>, "That edge is gone. Now all of a sudden, retail can be on the same footing and they don’t have to be the ‘bag holder’ to Wall Street." This is a revolutionary shift in the way trading may operate in the future, as the question now turns to what will happen next.

	Another concern is regarding Robinhood, a trading platform frequented by these so-called amateur investors. Robinhood suspended trading on Gamestop, among others, which prompted concerns surrounding the ethics of it. First of all, they were restricting free trading - something they had<a href="https://i.imgur.com/rnFEls0.jpg">previously denounced.</a>

<p>One on online community of WSB - ethics, concerns
</p>



As Chamath Palihapitiya, Social Capital CEO, mentions, "[to] a normal person that doesn’t make any sense. But to a Wall Street mathematician, that’s the game that’s been played. And that game came undone."
