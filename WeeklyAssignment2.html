	<!Introduction>
<p>
	On yet another Wednesday in January of 2021, we saw an unexpected, yet somewhat inevitable hit on the American stock market. Gamestop found itself caught in the middle of huge hedge funds and the 'little guy' Redditors - something you might not have ever expected to hear, but then again, we have been in a succession of wild events. This event began with large money managers essentially betting that Gamestop's stock would fall, which was noticed by Redditors on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">/r/WallStreetBets</a>. The Redditors then banded together, and drove Gamestop's price up dramatically. Now, we've seen both sides relentless to curb the activity of the other: Hedge funds want regulation against 'attacks' like this, while Redditors respond saying that we're just getting in on your own game. Of course, there have been several questions that have arisen regarding events like this in the future, ethics, and more. In this essay, I will discuss potential outcomes from the situation and how we should respond to the vast number of concerns that have emerged.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest concerns is regarding Robinhood, a trading platform frequented by these so-called amateur investors. Robinhood suspended trading on Gamestop, among others, which prompted concerns surrounding the ethics of it. First of all, they were restricting free trading - something they had <a href="https://i.imgur.com/rnFEls0.jpg">previously denounced.</a> Further, Citadel, a massive hedge fund who accounts for the majority of stock executions on Robinhood, was the group who ended up bailing out Melvin Capital - one of the hedge funds who was hurt badly by the short squeeze. This is a major conflict of interest: not only did Robinhood restrict people from trading, but they also did so under shady circumstances. This simply cannot be allowed. A lack of trust in giant hedge funds already existed before this situation, but the case of Robinhood only exacerbates that distrust.

	Another concern surrounding the Gamestop stock is whether groups like /r/WallStreetBets should be allowed to conspire like this. Of course, this concern is voiced primarily from the perspective of those who lost money - the giant hedge funds. While their concern may be valid, it is important to realize that this is really the first time that they have ever been truly beaten by someone. Typically, they are able to control markets without being totally transparent. The thing is, Wall Street hedge funds have been doing the exact same thing, just without a challenge. They have finally faced a challenger, and as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chamath/"> Chamath Palihapitiya</a>, Social Capital CEO, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/chamath-palihapitiya-closes-gamestop-position-but-defends-individual-investors-right-to.html">said in an interview</a>, "That edge is gone. Now all of a sudden, retail can be on the same footing and they don’t have to be the ‘bag holder’ to Wall Street." This is a revolutionary shift in the way trading may operate in the future, as the question now turns to what will happen next.

	The subreddit, /r/WallStreetBets is a prime example of how online communities have a ton of power. This community consists primarily of younger people, who have grown up not trusting big Wall Street investors. People now in their 20s and 30s saw what happened in 2008 - which stemmed essentially, from huge amounts of risk, all while these hedge fund managers saw what was going to happen. Chamath Palihapitiya <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/chamath-palihapitiya-closes-gamestop-position-but-defends-individual-investors-right-to.html">mentioned</a>, "[to] a normal person that doesn’t make any sense. But to a Wall Street mathematician, that’s the game that’s been played. And that game came undone." People are tired of seeing these huge funds play with money like it's a game, and Redditors were finally gifted the opportunity to do something about it. Although many still look at these people as a joke, they were able to make a lasting impact on our stock market. It is hard not to take them seriously, no matter how crass they may seem. Now that people who thought they were untouchable are being affected, there is a call for regulation. In reality, it is difficult to empathize with hedge fund managers, considering it was their risky decisions that ended up hurting them.

	Overall, it is obvious that this event will not be forgotten. Whether it is the beginning to a fundamental change in the way our stock market operates, or if we continue to see online communities manipulate the market. It is known how much of an impact social media has on our everyday life, but this event appears to have had one of the largest financial implications of social media yet. Although we cannot be sure how the future will look, we know that the ability of information exchanges over the internet is vastly important. Something like this never could have happened without the easy access to online communities like Reddit. It is important to keep that in mind going forward, regarding legislation and regulation changes.
